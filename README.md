# Bootcamp PreWork Study Guide WebPage

## Description

This Prework Study Guide was created for boot camp students who were going through the Prework.

This is project is part of the Fron-End Web Developer Bootcam I am taking part.
The bootcamp is focused on HTML, CSS and JavaScript, the basis to develop a valuable skill in order to be employed or improve your skillset. This project is the first of many, required and essential to give you a basic understanding of how the Bootcamp will be structure and what to expect. 

As well of giving a basic understanding of Web-Development programming languages, this project guides you through each step from creating a directory and linking it with an SSH key and make it public so anyone can see it. It can be said that this was build to practice creating your first website. 

While bulding this project/website many skills were learned: 
- HTML, CSS, JS (Tag, semantic structure, meta tags, etc...) (Stylesheet, how to make your webpage prettier, changing font, position, alignment of your element) (Using attributes to make your website more interactive with the end user)
- Creating a secure connection between your PC and Github using a SSH Key
- How to use GitHub and connect any made repository to a specified directory in your PC to allow to make changes and deploy your code
- Git to allow you to create quickly and push and pull your code
- Creating branches and solving issues
- Follow customer requests
- Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.")
- What problem does it solve?
- What did you learn?
